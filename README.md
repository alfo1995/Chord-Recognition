# Chord-Recognition

Given in input *.wav* file record extension, this is algorithm, implemented in **Matlab** and using **Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)**, recognizes the chord so the notes from which is composed.

For example, given in input the *Chord.wav* recording [Wav file ](Chord-Recognition/chord-recognition.m), the output is as follows:

:notes: The chord is: Major F#/Gb, composed by these 3 notes: F#/Gb, A#/Bb, C#/Db, >> :guitar:
